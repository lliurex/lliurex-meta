== Blacklist ==

libavcodec cannot be shipped on CDs (c.f. Ubuntu technical board resolution 2007-01-02).

 * !libavcodec*
 * (!fonts-guru)

== Intel Modesetting ==

We use modesetting in neon for intel https://phabricator.kde.org/T3734

 * xserver-xorg-video-intel-arbiter # This goes to either or
 * (xserver-xorg-video-intel-native-modesetting) # This is what we force
 * !xserver-xorg-video-intel # Don't want this.

== Input Drivers ==

We use evdev even on 18.04 where libinput is the platform default. This is
because our KCMs aren't up to the part. The actual preference switch is carried
out by neon-settings. We only need to make sure evdev is installed in some form.
This is only recommends so users can opt to switch to libiniput manually if
they so choose.

 * (xserver-xorg-input-evdev)

Also drag in synaptics. It's also available by default in xenial, alongside
evdev and its absence seems to cause trouble with certain touchpads
https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=397269

 * (xserver-xorg-input-synaptics)

== Oops handling ==

Disable oops handling by default. As of kcrash 5.29 oops are automatically forwarded to handlers, which by default would be apport, which we do not want. coredumpd might be handy, but is not used right now https://phabricator.kde.org/T3891

We will thus mangle the output by sedding out the following: kerneloops-daemon, whoopsie, apport, systemd-coredump.
This happens in our ./update script!

== Ubuntu Masking ==

Ubuntu has some excessively useless deps deep in the stack. We'll "mask" them
with our own empty versions to get rid of them.

 * (neon-adwaita) # https://phabricator.kde.org/T8363
 * (neon-ubuntu-advantage-tools) # https://phabricator.kde.org/T8633
 * (neon-apport) # https://phabricator.kde.org/T8659

== Sanity ==

 # Recommend vim so Harald doesn't smash his keyboard.
 * (vim)
 # Recommend curl because openqa/os-autoinst uses curl to upload artifacts from
 # the VM to the test driver.
 * (curl)
